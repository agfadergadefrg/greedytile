## Overview

GreedyTile is a simple yet powerful algorithm for generating random pixel patterns. It uses a greedy approach to create visually appealing designs. Whether you are an artist looking for inspiration or a developer seeking to implement unique backgrounds, GreedyTile has you covered.

## Features

- **Random Pattern Generation**: Create unique pixel patterns every time.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjust settings to get the desired look.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal resource usage for quick generation.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for developers to use in projects.

## Getting Started

To get started with GreedyTile, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/agfadergadefrg/greedytile.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure to install any required dependencies listed in the repository.

3. **Run the Algorithm**: Execute the main script to generate your pixel patterns.

## Usage

To use GreedyTile, run the following command:

```bash
python greedytile.py
```

You can customize parameters by modifying the configuration file or passing arguments through the command line.

## Algorithm Explanation

The GreedyTile algorithm works by iteratively filling a grid with colors based on a set of rules. It evaluates neighboring pixels and selects colors that maximize visual appeal. The process continues until the grid is fully populated.

### Steps Involved

1. **Initialization**: Start with an empty grid.
2. **Color Selection**: Choose a color based on neighboring pixels.
3. **Placement**: Place the selected color in the grid.
4. **Iteration**: Repeat until the grid is complete.

This method allows for a diverse range of patterns while maintaining coherence in design.

## Examples
